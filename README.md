# Game
 Building a simple game and manipulating the DOM (Exercise)
 
 # Guidelines </b>
 
- A random word will be displayed and the main goal of the game is to type the exact same word as fast as you can, and you must spell it correct. If you spell the word correct you'll get a score and also increase the time you have to play the game.

- The game will be time based, that means if you run out of time it will be game over. You can also choose between three different levels of difficulty in the game. And that's not all my friends! You will also learn how to save the difficulty you choose in local storage so when we for example refresh the browser we will not loose what difficulty we chose.

Instructions step by step(variables, functions, etc. ) are written in the file script.js
